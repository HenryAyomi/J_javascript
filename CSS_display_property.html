<!--in html they re 3 types of elemnt 
1)block elemnt :a block element take all the entire line, so a paragraph is a block element by default...the text extend to the end of the line
no matter how small the text is by default it will take up the entire line
2)inline-block element:this elemnt only takes up as much space as possible not the entire line e.g image and input element so another elment can appear beside them
3)inline element: basically text element they appear btw a text e,g strong,span,u 
WE CAN USE THE CSS PROPERTY CALLED DISPLAY TO SWITCH BTW BLOCK  AND INLINE BLOCK
